# 30 Days of Next.js and React UI Challenge

This repository chronicles my journey through a 30-day challenge focused on building user interfaces using Next.js and React. Each day, I'll create a new UI component or page inspired by online design resources.

**What You'll Find Here:**

- Design concept url from different resources
- Code for all the UI components and pages I build

**Challenge Progress:**

I'll be documenting my progress on a daily basis. Check out the specific folders or files within `src/` to see how the project evolves.

**Feel free to:**

- Use this repository to follow along and build your own UI components
- Explore the code and learn from the approaches I've taken
- Share your progress and learnings!

**Stay tuned!** As I complete the challenge, this repository will be filled with practical examples and code you can reference in your own front-end development endeavors.
